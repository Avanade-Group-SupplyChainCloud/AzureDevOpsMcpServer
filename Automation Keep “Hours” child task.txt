## Hours Task Sync Playbook (Auto-Continue, No Prompts)

### Rules

* **Follow the steps in order. Don’t skip steps.**
* **Do not ask for confirmation** (no "proceed?" / "can I update?").
* **Only use MCP tools you have available.**
* **Stop only on a hard stop:** required item/link not found, required data can’t be retrieved, no diffs exist, or the needed MCP action/tool isn’t available.

### Steps

1. Get User Story (include relations). Read: `AreaPath`, `IterationPath`, `StoryPoints`.
2. From the User Story’s child links, find the **Task** with **"Hours"** in the title (case-insensitive). If none, stop.
3. Get that **Hours** Task.
4. Compare Hours Task vs User Story. Build an update with only the fields that differ:

   * `AreaPath` = User Story `AreaPath`
   * `IterationPath` = User Story `IterationPath`
   * `OriginalEstimate` = User Story `StoryPoints`
   * If `CompletedWork` is empty: `RemainingWork` = User Story `StoryPoints`
5. If no fields differ, stop. Otherwise update the Hours Task with the changes from step 4.

**Test:** Run this for User Story **45715**.

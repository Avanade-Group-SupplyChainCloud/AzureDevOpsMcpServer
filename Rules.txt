Steps

Load User Story (include links/relations) and read: Title, Area Path, Iteration Path, Story Points, Activity.
Stop if Area Path is “Infrastructure” OR Activity is “Deployment”.
Create a Task with:
Title: “(Hours) ” + the story title
Area/Iteration: same as the story
Original Estimate + Remaining Work: equal to Story Points
Activity: “D365” if the story title contains “F&O” or “D365”, otherwise do nothing.
Link the Task as a child of the User Story (Hierarchy).
